# Contributing

## Setup

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the app with `npm run dev`.

## Development Guidelines

- Keep changes focused and small.
- Prefer clear, readable code over clever shortcuts.
- Update docs when behavior or setup changes.
- Do not commit local note content unless it is intentional fixture/sample data.

## Validation

There is currently no automated test suite. Before opening a PR:

1. Start the app locally (`npm start` or `npm run dev`)
2. Create/edit/delete a note and confirm the UI updates
3. Confirm markdown preview and wiki links still work

## Pull Requests

- Use a descriptive title.
- Include a short summary of what changed and why.
- Add screenshots/GIFs for UI changes.
- Link related issues when applicable.
