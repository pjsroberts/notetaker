# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest version on the default branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not report security issues in public GitHub issues.

Instead, contact the maintainer privately through GitHub (or use GitHub Security Advisories for this repository if enabled). Include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment (if known)
- Any suggested remediation

You can expect an acknowledgment within a reasonable timeframe, followed by triage and a fix/release plan if the issue is confirmed.
