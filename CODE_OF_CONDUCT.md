# Code of Conduct

## Our Standards

Participants are expected to:

- Be respectful and constructive
- Assume good intent while giving clear feedback
- Focus on the code and ideas, not personal attacks
- Avoid harassment, discrimination, and abusive behavior

## Scope

This applies to repository discussions, issues, pull requests, and other project communication spaces.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers may remove or moderate comments, issues, or contributions that violate this code of conduct.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, contact the maintainer privately through GitHub rather than opening a public thread.
